            <h2>My name is Ricardo Harris and I am learning computer science.</h2>
            <p>I was born March 10, 2000 in Glendale, California,
               USA. I spent my moving around from place to place in southern <br />
               California but I spent the majority of my childhood in Pasadena,
               CA. I had made a YouTube Channel "Ricffris Gamesalot" in 8th grade<br />
               with gameplays inspiring me to make the things I love so much;
               video games! My first experience with programming was in 8th grade<br />
               Robotics class with Mr.Crosby. There I had the help of his assistant
               Grant and my colleges to learn how to and preform how to program NXT <br />
               robots. My team won second place in the annual robotics competition
               of PUSD (Pasadena Unified School District). My school won every other <br />
               trophy and medal.Crosby was a very inspiring person, though he sugar
               coated nothing, he opened my eyes to how this world works. I was <br />
               taught that in this world there are producers and consumers. And
               I wanted to be a producer. Now I'm off to the right track by entering <br />
               the APP Academy teaching me more advanced coding tools than C language such
               as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I am a programmer, and <br />
               I'm preparing for the future. In this world there are thinkers
               and there are doers. And I ask myself "Why not be both?"</p>
            
            <p>This is a random paragraph. Not even worth reading. If you do decide
               to read this, don't. It really isn't worth it. This paragraph is<br />
               not necessary to read in order to understand this webpage. So stop,
               right now, cut it out, don't read this, its over, it actually ended<br />
               right now... matter of fact this paragraph isn't ending here. I
               think you should know something interesting about this paragraph. <br />
               The letters here are the actual color clear. Why that is a thing,
               I know not. So if you can read this, consider yourself superhuman.</p>
