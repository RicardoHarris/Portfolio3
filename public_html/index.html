            <h2>My name is Ricardo Harris and I am learning computer science.</h2>
            <p>This is a random example for this JQuery example page.</p>

            <p>This is a random paragraph. Not even worth reading. If you do decide
               to read this, don't. It really isn't worth it. This paragraph is<br />
               not necessary to read in order to understand this webpage. So stop,
               right now, cut it out, don't read this, its over, it actually ended<br />
               right now... matter of fact this paragraph isn't ending here. I
               think you should know something interesting about this paragraph. <br />
               The letters here are the actual color clear. Why that is a thing,
               I know not. So if you can read this, consider yourself superhuman.</p>
